        <h3>Graceful Companion</h3>

        <p>
            The domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small, furry, carnivorous mammal valued by humans for both companionship 
            and its ability to hunt vermin. Cats possess a unique blend of independence and affection, making them one 
            of the most popular pets worldwide.
            <br><br>
            Cats are highly specialized and agile predators with keen senses. They have excellent night vision due to a 
            light-reflecting layer in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum, allowing them to see in near darkness. Their 
            hearing is also acute, capable of detecting a broader range of frequencies than humans or dogs, and their large, 
            mobile outer ears help them pinpoint the source of sounds. Physical adaptations like sharp, retractable claws, 
            a flexible spine, and a powerful, specialized jaw equipped with carnassial teeth further aid their hunting prowess.
            <br><br>
            Behaviorally, cats conserve energy by sleeping a significant portion of the day, averaging 12 to 16 hours, an 
            activity often referred to as "cat naps". They communicate through a diverse range of vocalizations, including 
            meows, purrs, and hisses, as well as complex body language involving their tail position, ear movements, and 
            facial expressions. Purring often indicates contentment, but can also be a self-soothing mechanism when a cat 
            is stressed or in pain. Cats use scent glands on their paws, temples, and flanks to mark their territory and 
            social bonds, and are known for their fastidious self-grooming habits using their barbed tongues.
            <br><br>
            Originally domesticated around 9,500 years ago in the Near East, cats have maintained many of their wild traits 
            despite living alongside humans for millennia. They are found in over 60 recognized breeds, each with distinct 
            appearances and personalities, and continue to bring joy and comfort to households globally.
